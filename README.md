# Explore_Arrays

## Background & Objectives
In this project your are going to have a first contact with **sound** and **image** treatment with Python. This is just a taste of the amazing Machine Learning / Deep Learning **projects** you're gonna do with those skills!!

## Data
First, let's load four arrays stored in NPY format, using the numpy load function.

! curl https://wagon-public-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/03-Maths/algebra_explore_arrays.zip --output arrays.zip
! unzip arrays.zip
! rm arrays.zip

## Tools
For this challenge, we will work with Jupyter Notebook and some Python libraries such as numpy, matplotlib and pillow.
